# k-Nearest Neighbots in Java (REMASTERED)
_**k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in Java Applet - REMASTERED Edition**_

## Overview ##

Hi there! This is my implementation of k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm which is written in **Java** programming language and this aims to simulate on 2-dimensional plain space that contain many data objects distributed randomly and a query object that chooses its k-nearest data objects by calculating Euclidean distances against all; now upgraded to REMASTERED Edition!

Typically, kNN can be encountered in Machine Learning as a classification algorithm, which is simple but effective, easy to implement and yield very good results in most situations. Here, it is applied as the intention of **proximity querying** for selecting the nearest objects.

## A Brief History ##

Several years ago, I had created this useful applet while I was a PhD student in the university, with the objective to understand how algorithms that focused on proximity could work on open plain space much better. This was a good starting point for moving to other similar implementations in the future. To maintain the corresponding codes remotely, I found GitHub as a convenient place while also I was newcomer of that platform to get the hang of the logic of Git commands. But then, even after leaving PhD, I didn't make any changes and it was left untouched for several years!

As being one of my first repositories here, my initial version of kNN Java was becoming so obsolete through my eyes! For this reason, I overhauled everything, redesigned many pieces of the codebase, improved the general usability and even added new features to make it more educational and entertaining for everyone. As a consequence, I called it **Remastered Edition** to emphasize that the whole implementation has been renewed and it was convenient to use this buzzword that is seen for several video games in recent years. To be honest, this is one of my best programming projects I've so far! If you're a visitor of this repo, hopefully you'll like this applet.
